# Decoder Ring

The Decoder ring provides three basic encryption methods that allow the user to either encrypt or decrypt a message. Intended to be used for fun secret communication amongst friends. It provides three methods for encryptions Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, Substitution Cipher.

### Ceaser Shift 

The Ceaser Shift is a substitution cypher where the ciphertext alphabet is shifted a given number of spaces. In order to encrypt or decrypt a message the user will enter there message in the textarea and then enter in the encryption key which will be a either a positive negative number into the **Shift number** box under the textarea

### Polybius Square

The Polybius Square is a substitution cipher using a square grid. Each character of the plain message is replaced by a couple of coordinates defining its position in the grid. No Key is required for this cipher as it is created and encrypted/decrypted based off a set grid which does not change.

### Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher Encrypts by changing the letters of the alphabet to a new alphabet key. For example "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" would be changed to "poiuytrewqalskdjfhgmznxbcv". In order to encrypt/descrypt the user must provide a new Alphabet Key in the Alphabet key Input
